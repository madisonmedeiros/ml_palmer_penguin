# Penguin Health Prediction

## Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the health status of penguins based on various physical and environmental attributes. The goal is to demonstrate how different machine-learning techniques can be applied to a biological dataset to infer health conditions. This project is for educational use and intended to help students and enthusiasts understand the application of machine learning in biological sciences.

## Models Used

	•	Logistic Regression: Used for establishing a baseline for binary classification tasks.
	•	Decision Tree: Offers good interpretability and helps understand feature importance.
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Explores the impact of instance-based learning where predictions are based on neighborhood similarity.

## Dataset:

The dataset includes attributes such as species, island, sex, diet, year of data collection, life stage, body mass, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and health metrics of penguins. The specific details of the dataset sources and attributes are outlined below:

Attributes:
	•	Species: Species of the penguin (e.g., Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
	•	Island: The island where the penguin was found (e.g., Biscoe, Dream, Torgensen)
	•	Sex: Gender of the penguin (Male, Female)
	•	Diet: Primary diet of the penguin (Fish, Krill, Squid)
	•	Year: Year the data was collected (2021-2025)
	•	Life Stage: The life stage of the penguin (Chick, Juvenile, Adult)
	•	Body Mass (g): Body mass in grams
	•	Bill Length (mm): Bill length in millimeters
	•	Bill Depth (mm): Bill depth in millimeters
	•	Flipper Length (mm): Flipper length in millimeters
	•	Health Metrics: Health status of the penguin (Healthy, Overweight, Underweight)
